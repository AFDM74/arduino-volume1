===========================================
**Arduino tone() now has 8-bit volume control!**

Ever needed a project to play a tone through a speaker or piezo that *wasn't* blisteringly loud? You can bring the volume down with a resistor, but what if you needed a loud alert beep at some point as well?

**Now it's no longer an issue.** :) Using ultra-fast PWM, the Volume library allows the speaker itself to act as an RC filter to produce *smooth* (8-bit) analog-like volume control.
